# 10 Days of JavaScript @HackerRank
## Timeline
### Day 0
Simple challenge to take preassigned variables and readline standard input value and add numbers or concatenate strings and display it to the console. [data_typesHR.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesHR.js) includes code fromHackerRanks website so won't run properly, [data.typesRM.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesRM.js) will run with readline so the user can input data manually to have added to the preassigned variables and then console logged back to them.
