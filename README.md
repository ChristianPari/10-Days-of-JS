# 10 Days of JavaScript @HackerRank
## Timeline
### Day 1
Created multiple programs:
- Arithmitic Operators: this was an exercise to take readline input for a rectangles length and width, and then display back in the console the area and perimeter of the rectangle
- Functions: this was an exercise to factorialize a readline input and display back the factorialized number
- Let and Const: this was an exercise to find the area and perimeter of a circle via it's radius which was provided via readline input

### Day 0
Simple challenge to take preassigned variables and readline standard input value and add numbers or concatenate strings and display it to the console. [data_typesHR.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesHR.js) includes code fromHackerRanks website so won't run properly, [data.typesRM.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesRM.js) will run with readline so the user can input data manually to have added to the preassigned variables and then console logged back to them.
