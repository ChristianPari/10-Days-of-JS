# 10 Days of JavaScript @HackerRank
Within each day folder contains files that HackerRank assigned for that day. Files ending with 'HR' are HackerRanks' setup files that are submitted on the site, the others ending in 'RM' are the remaastered ones that I create myself with the same assignment but convert it into a readline program that does the same thing but in a slightly different way.
## Timeline
### Day 5
- Inheritance:
    - an exercise that had me learn how to create a custom method and add it to an exisiting class, along with then creating a sub class that inherits the method from that exisiting (super) class so that the sub class can then have the method ran for it's output
- Template Literals:
    - an exercise to evaluate data from an experssions array that is recieved via readline from HackerRank and then passed into a function which evaluates and returns the side lengths of the rectangle propeties (area and perimeter) that were found by excuting a opertaion using the indexes of the expressions array
- Arrow Functions:
    - an exercise to take in an array of numbers and return the array with odd numbers tripled and even numbers doubled

### Day 4
- Create Rectangle Object:
    - an exersice that has a function which takes in side lengths as arguments and returns an object with length, width, area, and perimeter properties
- Count Objects:
    - an exersice that loops through an array of objects and compares the properties within each object and returns how many times (in number form) the objects had that we're equal to one another
- Classes:
    - this exersice was to create a custom class named Polygon which has a constructor that takes in an array and then has a function that is ran to evaluate the perimeter

### Day 3
- Arrays:
    - an exersice that used a function that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns the second largest number in the array
- Try, Catch, Finally:
    - an exersice that uses a function to takes in an argument and if it is a string then it reverses and logs it, otherwise it logs an error
- Throw:
    - this exersice checks a number that is passed as an argument in a function to be positive, negative, or zero and returns 'YES' for positive or a specific throw error for the other possibilites

### Day 2
- If Else Statements:
    - an exersice that takes a numerical value between 0 and 30 and returns an A-F depending on the previous value
- Switch Statements:
    - this exercise takes in a string and depending on the first letter of that string will return a letter A-D
- Loops:
    - this exersice takes in a alphabet only string and logs the destructered vowels and then the consonants

### Day 1
- Arithmitic Operators:
    - an exercise to take readline input for a rectangles length and width, and then display back in the console the area and perimeter of the rectangle
- Functions:
    - an exercise to factorialize a readline input and display back the factorialized number
- Let and Const:
    - an exercise to find the area and perimeter of a circle via it's radius which was provided via readline input

### Day 0
Simple challenge to take preassigned variables and readline standard input value and add numbers or concatenate strings and display it to the console. [data_typesHR.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesHR.js) includes code fromHackerRanks website so won't run properly, [data.typesRM.js](https://github.com/ChristianPari/10-Days-of-JS/blob/master/day0/data_typesRM.js) will run with readline so the user can input data manually to have added to the preassigned variables and then console logged back to them.
